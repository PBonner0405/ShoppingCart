## Mattress Shop Page
Create a single page React application using the screen shot provided (mock.png) as your guide. Please use the data provided in mattresses.json to populate the mattress data in the application.

### Requirements: 
1. Application uses React framework.
2. The design should match the mock as best as possible.
   * You can use a design system (ex. Bootstrap) if preferred.
   * Use a cart icon of your choice.
3. The user should have the ability to toggle between mattresses.
4. As the mattress selection changes:
   * the selected mattress name and price should be reflected below the mattress toggle.
   * the selected mattress image should be reflected to the left of the configuration area (images files can be found in /images)
5. The "Add to Cart" button should increment the cart item count (in the top right of the view) 
6. The application you create should be responsive though we have only provided the design for the desktop experience. You are responsible for deciding how the application will scale to a mobile experience. This is your opportunity to be creative.
7. Use fonts 'Source Serif Pro' for the "Choose Your Mattress" header and 'Questrial' for body copy. These can be found on google fonts website.


### Bonus Points:
1. Use a css preprocessor if you prefer sass or less.
2. Display the Review Rating for the selected mattress.
2. Add animation where you see fit.
3. Add your own flair to the design.
4. Add a unit test for the "Add to Cart" functionality.
