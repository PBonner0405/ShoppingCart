The club saw a situation developing for several weeks and months, one that had been relatively under control.<\/p><p>\u201CHowever, in my opinion, over the last few days he lost five important players and that became difficult to sustain.<\/p><p>\u201CAs a Coach, you cannot work with five of your most prominent players as opponents. The enemy by your side is the most dangerous, so that\u2019s why we had to act.\u201D<\/p><p>Among those believed to be against Ancelotti were Franck Ribery and Kingsley Coman.<\/p><p>Ancelotti saluted Bayern Munich with a typically classy message via Twitter.<\/p><p>\u201CIt has been a great honour to form part of Bayern\u2019s history. I would like to thank the Club, the Players and its amazing fans. #MiaSanMia \u201D<\/p>",

I believed to the end, but there weren’t the conditions to carry on the negotiations.</p><p>“I will do what I have to do. The problem is not the protests from the fans, nor their insults, because I am used to them now. I just want to make sure these 14 years are not wasted or destroyed. I believe I did the right thing.</p><p>“I was never that certain about the SRI Group, but there were reliable people pushing me in that direction and I thought they must have the foundations to conclude it. That wasn’t the case, so now what do I do?</p><p>“As President, it is my duty towards the fans, the club, the players and staff to do my duty. I won’t stop looking for a buyer. We will enact due diligence, so nobody can say we’ve got skeletons in the closet.</p><p>“Some might not believe me, but Genoa are in better shape than people think. I always paid my debts, the only blemish was the failure to get the UEFA licence.</p><p>“I realise that made the fans suffer, but I apologised enough for that. I paid enough and I am still paying.”</p><p>Genoa had qualified for the Europa League at the end of the 2014-15 season, but were not allowed into the tournament because the club had unpaid debts and a financial guarantee to temporarily cover the gap was not registered correctly.</p>",

I was a little more fired up with Leonardo Bonucci, as he is the captain and ought to set the example on how to control a leading situation, but it was an affectionate telling off.<\/p><p>\u201CWe must improve our defensive movements, as we have perhaps struggled a little in terms of temperament under the weight of expectations. Rijeka played a consistently aggressive match and we should\u2019ve created more chances, especially in the first half.<\/p><p>\u201CThere are negative and positive elements that come out from game to game. We want the growth to last for the entire 95 minutes, that isn\u2019t happening yet, so I am here to work and improve the team.<\/p><p>\u201CWe go home with far more experience and spirit than if we had won comfortably. If Donnarumma had saved the penalty, we wouldn\u2019t have been as happy, because we saw the desire and energy to turn things around and react to setbacks.<\/p><p>\u201CI see the glass half-full, as we learned some valuable lessons and, of course, we won.\u201D<\/p>",

However, Andre Silva created a goal out of nothing, bursting down the left and cutting back inside the defender to smash his finish across the <span class=\"vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default\"><span class=\"vm-hook\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);\">goalkeeper<\/span><span class=\"vm-hook-icon\" style=\"display: inline-block;\"><\/span><\/span> from a tight angle.<\/p><p>However, Puljic came close to an equaliser, his header too weak to trouble Gianluigi Donnarumma.<\/p><p>Fabio Borini in a new wide left role blasted off target, but the first half was largely uninspired.

Donnarumma guessed the right angle, but couldn\u2019t keep out the Elez penalty.<\/p><p>It seemed as if they were doomed to an embarrassing draw at San Siro, but in stoppages Fabio Borini\u2019s ball over the top allowed teenage hitman Cutrone to spring the offside trap and he stuck out a toe to flick it beyond the goalkeeper.

They were top of the group going in, as Lyon were surprisingly held 1-1 by a last-gasp Apollon Limassol goal.<\/p><p>As expected, the hosts poured forward from the start, a Bertrand Traore angled drive was deflected wide and Etrit Berisha scrambling to push a Mariano Diaz screamer round the base of the near post.<\/p><p>Atalanta took a while to get into the game, but on 24 minutes Leonardo Spinazzola\u2019s cross found Hans Hateboer only for the header to somehow go wide of the far post from a couple of yards.<\/p><p>Berisha palmed a Mariano Diaz free kick over the bar, but from that corner the looping Kenny Tete header surprised the goalkeeper to thump the spot where the upright meets the crossbar.<\/p><p>Just as Atalanta thought they\u2019d made it to the half-time break, Lyon found a way through. Nabil Fekir turned Marten de Roon inside out down the left flank, his taut cross at the near post found Traore\u2019s back-heel flick and a sensational Berisha save, but the Lyon man reacted quickest on the rebound.<\/p><p>After the restart, Andrea Petagna\u2019s chest and volley was deflected wide for a corner, but Atalanta got a deserved equaliser with Papu Gomez. Mattia Caldara was brought down on the edge of the box and on that touched-on free kick, Gomez unleashed a missile that split the defensive wall to leave Anthony Lopes no chance at the near post.<\/p><p>Papu pointed to his name on the back of his jersey, as before this game Lyon players confessed they\u2019d never heard of him. They know who he is now.<\/p><p>The hosts resumed their siege, Caldara flinging himself in the path of a Mariano Diaz strike, then on the resulting corner Castagne practically cleared Tete\u2019s head off the line.<\/p><p>Berisha had his gloves stung by Ndombele from distance, then on 74 minutes Tete\u2019s cross took a massive deflection off Caldara, but the Albanian goalkeeper adjusted for a fantastic save at the near post.<\/p><p>Spinazzola spun round a dizzied defender at the by-line, but his cross was deflected and Atalanta hung on for dear life under pressure to earn a precious point.<\/p><p><strong>Lyon 1-1 Atalanta<\/strong><\/p><p>Traore 44 (L), Gomez 57 (A)<\/p><p><strong>Lyon:<\/strong>&nbsp;Lopes; Tete, Marcelo, Morel, Mendy; Ndombele, Tousart; Traore (Cornet 85), Fekir, Aouar (Depay 70); Mariano Diaz (Maolida 70)<\/p><p><strong>Atalanta:<\/strong>&nbsp;Berisha; Masiello, Caldara, Palomino; Hateboer, Cristante (Castagne 46), De Roon, Freuler, Spinazzola; Petagna (Ilicic 60), Gomez<\/p><p><strong>Ref: <\/strong>Siebert (GER)<\/p>",

It\u2019s only natural after the third game in a week, mind you. Now we must recover our strength for Sunday.\u201D<\/p>\r\n<p>Immobile came off the bench and contributed with a splendid late goal.<\/p><p>\u201CCaicedo and Immobile proved they can play together. Luis Alberto had a nasty knock and his foot has swollen up, so we\u2019ll see what happens, but hopefully it\u2019s nothing serious. He\u2019s having tests.<\/p><p>\u201CI think this side is mature to play in three tournaments. Last season I often changed system, but the team has a certain identity now and I want to help my players feel more secure.<\/p><p>\u201CEven if we\u2019re in an emergency situation in defence now, Patric was extraordinary in a role he\u2019s never played before. I could\u2019ve given Luis Nani his debut, but it was too important for us to follow up the victory over Vitesse with another win.\u201D<\/p>",
